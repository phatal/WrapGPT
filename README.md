Simple android webview wrapper for chatGPT but generated by chatGPT

I was annoyed every time I had to switch to the right tab in my mobile browser. As I hadn't been coding for Android in a while, I used ChatGPT to generate an app description, which I then used as a prompt for further generation. After a few messages to clarify details, I inserted the code into Android Studio and built an APK that worked flawlessly. (One correction, I also added the "android.widget.Toast" import to be 100% honest.)
